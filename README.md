**Lab: Building a Music Artist List App in React**

**Objective:** Construct a basic Music Artist List App using React. By the end of this lab, the student will be proficient in creating, importing, and managing state within React components.

**Instructions:**

1. **Develop the `MyArtistList` Component**
   - Create a component file named `src/components/MyArtistList.js`.
   - Design the component to display a default list of artists.
   - Utilize the `useState` hook to manage and update the list of artists.

2. **Integrate `MyArtistList` into the App**
   - Go to `src/App.js`.
   - Incorporate the `MyArtistList` component to show beneath the main title.

3. **Implement Artist Addition Feature**
   - Return to `src/components/MyArtistList.js`.
   - Add functionality allowing users to type and add new artists to the music artist list.
   - Ensure the new artist input and the add button are part of the component's return.

**Challenge:** 

Now that you've built a Music Artist List App, can you figure out how to delete an artist from the list? It might be a little tricky, but remember, every developer goes through this journey of learning and problem-solving. Using resources like Google or YouTube can be immensely helpful. It might get frustrating, but the journey is worth it. Embrace the learning process, and always remember: "Bing bong, meow meow!"

After you've finished, please ensure you commit and push your code. Additionally, verify that your Codio status on this lab is set to 'completed'.
